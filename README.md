# surfnet
Matlab Implementation of SurfNet
Requires Matlab, and blended intrinsic maps binaries. 
Download the geometry image code too in the other folder. I have only uploaded the shape creation files. The deep learning files using Matconvnet will follow shortly. Please let me know at sinhayan@ gmail.com if you run into problems executing the code or see bugs. 

Cite SurfNet: Generating 3D shape surfaces using deep residual networks, A. Sinha, A. Unmesh, Q. Huang and K. Ramani, CVPR 2017 if you use this code.
