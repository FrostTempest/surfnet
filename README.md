# surfnet
Matlab Implementation of SurfNet
Requires Matlab, and blended intrinsic maps binaries. 
Download the geometry image code too in the other folder. I have only uploaded the shape creation files. The deep learning files using Matconvnet will follow shortly. Please let me know at sinhayan@ gmail.com if you run into problems executing the code or see bugs.
